# Basis Universal Texture Compression Tool

A web-based tool for compressing image textures using the Basis Universal GPU texture format. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for converting images to highly compressed GPU textures that can be efficiently loaded in web applications.

## Features

- Multiple compression modes:
  - ETC1S: Low-medium quality with transparency support
  - UASTC LDR: High quality for standard images
  - UASTC LDR RDO: Optimized high quality with rate-distortion optimization
  - UASTC HDR 4x4: High quality HDR support
  - UASTC HDR 6x6: HDR with smaller file sizes
  - GPU Photo: Special intermediate HDR format
- Customizable compression options for each mode
- Mipmap generation support
- Real-time preview of compressed textures
- File size comparison
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Support for PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP formats
- Automatic image dimension validation (multiples of 4)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Basis Universal command-line tool
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
cd basis-universal-web
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install the Basis Universal command-line tool:

```bash
# Instructions vary by platform
# See: https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:3001` (backend).

## Usage

1. Upload an image by dragging and dropping or clicking the upload area
2. Select a compression mode based on your needs:
   - ETC1S for general web images with transparency
   - UASTC modes for higher quality requirements
   - HDR modes for high dynamic range images
3. Adjust compression options:
   - Quality (1-255) for ETC1S
   - RDO Quality (0.2-3.0) for UASTC RDO
   - Lambda and Level for HDR modes
4. Enable mipmaps if needed
5. Click "Start Compression"
6. Preview the results and download the compressed files

## API Endpoints
